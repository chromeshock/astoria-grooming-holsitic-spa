    catLionCut: `
This service includes body shaving, mane maintenance, and grooming of the feet and a portion of the tail. We also clip nails, clean ears, and offer a dry bath featuring a specialized shampoo with micro-crystals to cleanse your cat's skin. Additional charges may apply if the cat has severely matted fur. We do not shave cats over 14 years old or underweight cats due to the fragility of their skin and the potential for injury from the clippers.

For first-time clients, we require an initial evaluation to assess the cat's behavior. If the cat exhibits signs of extreme stress or aggression, we may be unable to provide the full range of services. However, you will only be charged for the services we are able to complete. For example, if we only manage to clip the nails, you will only be charged for that service.

We do not administer any sedatives or relaxants, as that goes against our policy. All grooming sessions are conducted in separate rooms to minimize stress, particularly for cats. A Rabies Certificate is required for all pets.`,
