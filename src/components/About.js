                        We have designed a special place for your beloved pets, we aim to be the more than just regular grooming salon, our atmosphere is cage free. Each client has a separate grooming room, with special accommodations to keep our cat clients isolated. Our tables and hydraulic bathtubs make it easier to handle both long and extra long dog breeds.
