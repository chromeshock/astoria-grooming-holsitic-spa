                <p className='about-txt'>We've designed a special place for your beloved pets. We aim to be more than just a regular grooming salon; our atmosphere is cage-free. Each client has a separate grooming room, with special accommodations to keep our cat clients isolated. Our tables and hydraulic bathtubs make it easier to handle both long and extra-long dog breeds</p>
